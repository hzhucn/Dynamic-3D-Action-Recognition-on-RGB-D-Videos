@ How to Run:

At first extract the vlfeat-0.9.20.rar file at the vl_feat directory. then run the "Main_MSRAction3D" for both feature extraction and classification.
You can run Step1_Extract_Features for extracting featres form train and test videos, it will save extracted featuers at mat file.
Step2_Description and Classification will load the mat file that genereted in Step1, for Vlad description and classification.
